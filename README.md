# Kinetis FRDM Expansion Board Template

Expansion Board Template for Freescale Kinetis Freedom Dev Boards for KiCAD.  Copy to your design and get started without having to wrestle with the mechanical details.  Be sure to double check though before sending the board out!

Derived from Freescale's FRDM-K64F gerber files.  Gerber files were read in with GerbView and imported into Pcbnew.

Enjoy!
